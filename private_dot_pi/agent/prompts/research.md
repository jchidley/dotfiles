description: Finalize this session into a coherent research note in ~/research (not compaction)
---
You are finalizing this session into a durable research note.

This is **not** context compaction. This is a coherent write-up of completed work for storage in `~/research`.

## Scope defaults
- Default scope is **this current session only**.
- If I explicitly ask to include other sessions, include them.

## Process
1. Ask clarifying questions first (adapt them to the subject and recent summary context), then wait for answers.
2. Review this session and relevant artifacts.
3. Draft and save a research note to `~/research/<date-and-topic>.md`.
4. Use section structure based on the content (not a rigid template).

## Required inclusion
- Always include source session references:
  - session file path
  - session ID (if available)

## Content rules
- Drive structure and tone from the subject matter.
- Include dead ends only when directly relevant to the final understanding.
- Include raw evidence snippets only when useful; otherwise synthesize.
- Include open questions / uncertainties / next steps only if they genuinely fit.
- Include decisions only when they are materially part of the outcome.

## File handling
- Never overwrite an existing research file unless explicitly requested.
- If filename collides, ask for confirmation or create a clearly versioned alternative.

Start by asking clarifying questions only.
