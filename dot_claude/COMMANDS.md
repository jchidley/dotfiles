## Command Workflow Integration

The recommended workflow for multi-session development:

```
/start ‚Üí work ‚Üí /checkpoint ‚Üí work ‚Üí /wrap-session
  ‚Üë                                         ‚Üì
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Next Session ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

For new features:
1. `/req check` - Verify if it's a requirement
2. `/req add` - Add to REQUIREMENTS.md
3. `/plan` or `/plan-tdd` - Create implementation plan
4. `/do-plan` - Execute the plan
5. `/checkpoint` - Save progress
6. `/req-to-issue` - Create GitHub tracking

## File Structure

When deployed by chezmoi:
- `~/.claude/COMMANDS.md` - This documentation file
- `~/.claude/commands/*.md` - Individual command execution instructions
- `~/.claude/plans/` - Generated development plans
- `~/.claude/sessions/` - Archived session logs

## Best Practices

1. Always `/start` at the beginning of a session
2. Use `/checkpoint` at natural breaking points
3. Always `/wrap-session` before ending work
4. Use `/req` commands for new feature requests
5. Prefer `/plan-tdd` for new feature development
6. Use `/security-review` before committing sensitive changes

## Built-in Claude Code Commands

In addition to custom `/project:*` commands, these built-in commands are available:
- `/pr_comments` - View pull request comments
- `/review` - Request code review
- `/status` - View account and system statuses
- `/memory` - Open memory files in editor
- `/terminal-setup` - Install Shift+Enter key binding for newlines
- `/compact` - Clear conversation while keeping files
- `/clear` - Full reset of conversation and context

## Implementation Notes

Commands should be written as direct instructions to Claude without explanatory text. Each command file should assume Claude has access to:
- All project files via Read/Write tools
- Git operations via Bash
- Context from HANDOFF.md and SESSION logs
- This documentation for understanding command purposes
