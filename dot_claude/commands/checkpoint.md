Latest: [Most recent accomplishment/discovery]

## Essential Context

- [Critical fact 3]
(Max 5 bullets - only what's needed RIGHT NOW)

## Next Step

## Related Documents
[Auto-discover and list if exist:]
- TODO.md - Active tasks
- PROJECT_WISDOM.md - Technical insights
- CLAUDE.md - Project-specific instructions
- SESSION_*.md - Recent work logs

If significant discovery occurred:
1. Check if PROJECT_WISDOM.md exists
2. If exists and has hierarchical structure, append to "Active Insights"
3. If exists as simple file, append directly
4. Format:
   ### [Date]: [Discovery]
   Insight: [The realization in one sentence]
   Impact: [Why this matters]
5. If PROJECT_WISDOM.md > 5KB, suggest migrating to hierarchical structure

After update, suggest: "Consider git push to backup progress"
