Create sessions directory if it doesn't exist:
- Check if sessions/ directory exists
- If not, create it with: mkdir -p sessions

Clean up checkpoint:
- Delete SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md if exists

Create sessions/SESSION_[YYYYMMDD]_[HHMMSS].md:

# Session [YYYYMMDD]_[HHMMSS]
Project: [Name]

## Work Done
[List what was actually accomplished - focus on completions]

## Failed Approaches
[Only if any - what didn't work and why]

## Commits
[git log --oneline output for this session]

Update HANDOFF.md:
- Refresh "Current State" with final status
- Update "Latest" with session's main achievement
- Ensure "Next Step" is current for next session (consider pending REQUIREMENTS.md items)
- Clear "If Blocked" if resolved

Check for uncommitted changes:
- Run git status
- If changes exist, remind: "Uncommitted changes detected. Consider committing before ending session."

Check and archive PROJECT_WISDOM.md if > 5KB:
1. If PROJECT_WISDOM.md exists and > 5KB:
   - Create PROJECT_WISDOM_ARCHIVE_[YYYYMMDD].md
   - Move older insights (keep last 10-15 active)
   - Add note after header: *Note: Older insights archived to PROJECT_WISDOM_ARCHIVE_[date].md*
2. If not exists but session had discoveries, create with:
   # Project Wisdom
   
   Insights and lessons learned from development.
   
   ## Active Insights

Check for cleanup:
- If SESSION_*.md files exist in root: "Run 'mv SESSION_*.md sessions/' to organize"

Tool Permission Management:
1. Track all tool permission requests during this session:
   - Check for tools that were granted permission (you used them)
   - Check for tools that were denied permission (you were blocked)
   - Create a list of new permissions not in .claude/settings.local.json

2. If new permissions found, prompt user:
   "üîß Tool Permission Update Required
   
   The following tools were used during this session:
   
   ‚úÖ ALLOWED (will be added to allow list):
   - Bash(git status:*)
   - WebFetch(domain:api.example.com)
   
   ‚ùå DENIED (will be added to deny list):
   - WebFetch(domain:suspicious-site.com)
   
   Do you want to:
   [A] Accept all changes
   [M] Modify selections
   [S] Skip permission updates
   
   Your choice: "

3. If user chooses [M], show each permission individually:
   "Bash(git status:*) - Currently: ALLOWED
   [K] Keep as allowed
   [D] Change to denied
   [S] Skip (don't add to either list)
   Your choice: "

4. Update .claude/settings.local.json based on user choices:
   - Add new allowed permissions to "allow" array
   - Add new denied permissions to "deny" array
   - Preserve existing permissions
   - Ensure no duplicates
