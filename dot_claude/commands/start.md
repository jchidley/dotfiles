Check git state:
- Run git branch --show-current
- Run git status  
- Run git log --oneline -5

Check for key files:
1. HANDOFF.md â†’ Read (primary project state)
2. SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md â†’ If exists, session was compacted mid-work
3. TODO.md â†’ Read if exists (active tasks)
4. CLAUDE.md â†’ Read if exists (project instructions)

Output format:

## Project: [Name from HANDOFF]
Status: [from HANDOFF Current State]
Branch: [git branch] | Changes: [Yes/No]

Current focus: [If SESSION_CHECKPOINT exists, use its Task; else use HANDOFF Next Step]

Ready to: [specific action]

  Status: Initial setup
  Target: [To be defined]
  Latest: Starting new work
  
  ## Essential Context
