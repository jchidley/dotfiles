Check git state:
- Run git branch --show-current
- Run git status  
- Run git log --oneline -5

Check for key files:
1. HANDOFF.md â†’ Read (primary project state)
2. SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md â†’ If exists, session was compacted mid-work
3. TODO.md â†’ Read if exists (active tasks)
4. PROJECT_WISDOM.md â†’ If exists, show last 3-5 insights as reminders
5. CLAUDE.md â†’ Read if exists (project instructions)

Output format:

## Project: [Name from HANDOFF]
Status: [from HANDOFF Current State]
Branch: [git branch] | Changes: [Yes/No]

Current focus: [If SESSION_CHECKPOINT exists, use its Task; else use HANDOFF Next Step]

[If PROJECT_WISDOM.md exists with insights:]
Recent learnings:
â€¢ [Last insight title]: [Impact in one line]
â€¢ [Second-to-last insight]: [Impact]
[Show up to 3-5 most recent]

Ready to: [specific action]

ðŸ’¡ Reminder: See WORKING_WITH_CLAUDE.md for collaboration tips

For new work (no HANDOFF.md):

  # Project: [Name]
  Updated: [Timestamp]
  
  ## Current State
  Status: Initial setup
  Target: [To be defined]
  Latest: Starting new work
  
  ## Essential Context
