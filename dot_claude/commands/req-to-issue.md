# /req-to-issue - Create GitHub Issue from Requirement

**CLAUDE INSTRUCTION**: When the user invokes this command with a REQ number, YOU MUST execute the following actions to create a GitHub issue.

## Command Action

When user types `/req-to-issue REQ-XXXX`, execute these steps:

1. **Read the requirement** from REQUIREMENTS.md for the specified REQ number
2. **Extract details**: name, description, rationale, priority, dependencies
3. **Create GitHub issue** using gh command with:
   - Title: `[REQ-XXXX] Requirement Name`
   - Labels: `requirement`, priority level (high/medium/low)
   - Detailed body with implementation sections
4. **Update REQUIREMENTS.md** to include the created issue number
5. **Return the issue URL** to the user

## Execution Steps

1. First, read REQUIREMENTS.md and find the requirement
2. Create the issue body with all sections for detailed notes
3. Use gh issue create command
4. Update REQUIREMENTS.md with the issue number

```markdown
## Description
[Insert requirement description from REQUIREMENTS.md]

## Rationale
[Insert rationale from REQUIREMENTS.md]

## Dependencies
[List any dependencies from REQUIREMENTS.md or "None"]

## Implementation Details

### Design Decisions
- [ ] Define overall architecture approach
- [ ] Identify key components/modules
- [ ] Document API contracts/interfaces
- [ ] Consider error handling strategy

### Technical Approach
```
// Document implementation approach here
// Include pseudo-code or architecture diagrams
```

### Code Examples
```[language]
// Add implementation code examples as work progresses
// Include both successful and edge cases
```
