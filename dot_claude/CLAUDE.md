# CLAUDE.md - Global Configuration
# Applies to all projects unless overridden

## Identity & Interaction
- Always address me as "Jack"
- Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- If having trouble, stop and ask for help
- If sudo is needed, ask me to run the exact sudo command required in a separate command prompt

## Development Work
For all development standards, language selection, testing practices, and tooling guidance:
**`cd /home/jack/tools` for development work**

See `/home/jack/tools/CLAUDE.md` for comprehensive development standards.

## Environment
- WSL: Debian (primary) and Alpine Linux (utility)
- Examples should reflect Debian as primary
