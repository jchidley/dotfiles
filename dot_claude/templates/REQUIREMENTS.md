# Requirements and Rationale

## Important Note on Requirement Numbering

**CRITICAL**: REQ numbers (e.g., REQ-0001, REQ-0029, etc.) are permanent identifiers and must NEVER be renumbered or changed. When requirements are removed, deprecated, or superseded, their numbers should be retired and not reused. This ensures traceability and prevents confusion in documentation, implementation tracking, and historical references.
