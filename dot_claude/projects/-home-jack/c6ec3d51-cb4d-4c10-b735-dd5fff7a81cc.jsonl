It usually has headers and the package names might not always be in the first column.\n\nAlso, I should add some error handling and make sure the script is robust.\n\nLet me also think about whether there are any edge cases:\n- What if an app is already installed in scoop?\n- What if uninstall fails?\n- What if install fails?\n- What about apps with different names between package managers?\n\nI should also add some safety checks and maybe a confirmation prompt.\n\nActually, let me revise this to be more robust and add proper error handling.","signature":"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"},{"type":"text","text":"Looking at this carefully, there are a few issues with my script that need fixing:\n\n1.

Basic usage:\n```\nscoop install <package-name>\n```\n\nScoop lets you install multiple packages specified and separated by spaces. This feature is helpful when you already have a list of packages to install.\n\n### List Command\nList installed apps using the `list` command. Important note: running scoop list will show the LATEST version installed, not all of them. To see all versions of a specific app, run scoop info <app> to see all installed versions of a particular app.\n\n### Search Command\nSearch available apps using the `search` command. Usage:\n```\nscoop search <package-name>\n```\n\nHowever, there's a limitation: even though manifests often include a \"description\" field, it is not used by the search command - so you have to know at least part of the apps name. Without any parameters, search will dump a list of all apps from all added buckets - which can be a lot of output so use with care.\n\n### Uninstall Command\nUse scoop uninstall [app].

Basic usage:\n```\nscoop install <package-name>\n```\n\nScoop lets you install multiple packages specified and separated by spaces. This feature is helpful when you already have a list of packages to install.\n\n### List Command\nList installed apps using the `list` command. Important note: running scoop list will show the LATEST version installed, not all of them. To see all versions of a specific app, run scoop info <app> to see all installed versions of a particular app.\n\n### Search Command\nSearch available apps using the `search` command. Usage:\n```\nscoop search <package-name>\n```\n\nHowever, there's a limitation: even though manifests often include a \"description\" field, it is not used by the search command - so you have to know at least part of the apps name. Without any parameters, search will dump a list of all apps from all added buckets - which can be a lot of output so use with care.\n\n### Uninstall Command\nUse scoop uninstall [app]. This command removes the specified application from your system.\n\n### Additional Useful Commands\nThe complete command list includes:\n\nalias Manage scoop aliases bucket Manage Scoop buckets cache Show or clear the download cache checkup Check for potential problems cleanup Cleanup apps by removing old versions config Get or set configuration values create Create a custom app manifest depends List dependencies for an app export Exports (an importable) list of installed apps help Show help for a command home Opens the app homepage install Install apps list List installed apps prefix Returns the path to the specified app reset Reset an app to resolve conflicts search Search available apps status Show status and check for new app\n\n### Getting Help\nInformation on Scoop's commands is built-in. If you use Git you should find the help interface familiar. You can get help for any command using:\n```\nscoop help <command>\n```"],"durationSeconds":17.574640430003406}}

Here's what you need to know:\n\n### Standard Output Format\n\nCurrently, clist -lo outputs a list of strings formatted as [package name] [version number] by default.\n\n### Machine-Readable Output Format\n\nIf parsing output, you might want to use --limit-output/-r to get output in a more machine parseable format.\n\nWhen using the `-r` or `--limit-output` switch with `choco list -lo` (local only), the output looks like this when choco list -lo -r: 7zip|9.22.01.20130618 7zip.commandline|16.02 7zip.install|9.22.01.20130618.\n\n### Key Output Formats:\n\n1. **Pipe-Separated Format**: choco list -lo -r is what you are looking for for what is installed and produces output in the format `package_name|version`.\n\n2. **Processing in PowerShell**: You can parse this output easily in PowerShell. I gave it a very fast spike choco list -lo -r | %{$_.split('|')} to prove that you could split up the output.\n\n### Important Version Changes:\n\nSince version 2.0 it no more accepts --lo (=local) argument and every call is considered against local packages. However, To ensure we do not break any existing automation, integrations or scripts using the --limit-output or -r along with -l, -a or one of their aliases, will continue to run and will not produce an error. Only a warning will be added to the logs.\n\n### PowerShell Integration:\n\nChocolatey uses PowerShell, but it is an exe, so it cannot return PowerShell objects. Use exit codes to determine status. Chocolatey exits with 0 when everything worked appropriately and other exits codes like 1 when things error.\n\n### Practical Examples:\n\nFor getting just package names without versions:\nchoco list --local-only --limit-output --id-only to list installed package names\n\nFor machine-readable parsing in PowerShell scripts:\nAlmost all chocolatey commands make use of the -r, --limitoutput, --limit-output switch which provides consistent pipe-separated output format.\n\nThe key takeaway is that using `choco list -r` (or `--limit-output`) provides a pipe-separated format that's ideal for PowerShell parsing and automation scripts."}]},"uuid":"a9f2898c-f166-4045-8784-a83664769f92","timestamp":"2025-05-22T11:58:17.638Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"chocolatey choco list command output format PowerShell","results":["I'll search for information about the Chocolatey choco list command output format in PowerShell.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01SbWyjgW7e9r4CjtyWsqWNA","content":[{"title":"Chocolatey Software Docs | Commands","url":"https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/"},{"title":"Output choco list -lo with table formatting · Issue #359 · chocolatey/choco","url":"https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/359"},{"title":"Chocolatey Software Docs | Setup / Install","url":"https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup/"},{"title":"Chocolatey Software Docs | List","url":"https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/list/"},{"title":"Chocolatey Software Docs | PowerShell Functions Reference","url":"https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions/"},{"title":"powershell - Can I export the list of installed packages in a machine-readable format? - Stack Overflow","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39382274/can-i-export-the-list-of-installed-packages-in-a-machine-readable-format"},{"title":"JSON output for some commands · Issue #1252 · chocolatey/choco","url":"https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1252"},{"title":"PowerShell script to install Chocolatey and a list of packages - Stack Overflow","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48144104/powershell-script-to-install-chocolatey-and-a-list-of-packages"},{"title":"Chocolatey Software Docs | Getting Started","url":"https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/getting-started/"},{"title":"chocolatey/choco","url":"https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsReference"}]},"Let me search for more specific information about the Chocolatey list command output format.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01XaUsiid82ZeqiXWvnc8pt6","content":[{"title":"Output choco list -lo with table formatting · Issue #359 · chocolatey/choco","url":"https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/359"},{"title":"`choco config list --limit-output` does not limit output as expected · Issue #2013 · chocolatey/choco","url":"https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/2013"},{"title":"source list - running with -r fails to escape pipe (|) char · Issue #1614 · chocolatey/choco","url":"https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1614"},{"title":"Chocolatey Software Docs | List","url":"https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/list/"},{"title":"powershell - Can I export the list of installed packages in a machine-readable format? - Stack Overflow","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39382274/can-i-export-the-list-of-installed-packages-in-a-machine-readable-format"},{"title":"Chocolatey Software Docs | Commands","url":"https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/"},{"title":"pipe - How can I put Powershell pipeline output into a command that doesn't support pipeline input (multiple arguments)? - Stack Overflow","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63291473/how-can-i-put-powershell-pipeline-output-into-a-command-that-doesnt-support-pip"},{"title":"How to get a list of packages from one machine and install in another with Chocolatey? - Stack Overflow","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43167087/how-to-get-a-list-of-packages-from-one-machine-and-install-in-another-with-choco"},{"title":"powershell - Chocolatey command to verify installed package regardless of chocolatey 1/2 version - Stack Overflow","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76554860/chocolatey-command-to-verify-installed-package-regardless-of-chocolatey-1-2-vers"},{"title":"List output for other tools messed up in 0.9.9.9 (pipe separator missing) · Issue #450 · chocolatey/choco","url":"https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/450"}]},"Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the Chocolatey `choco list` command output format when used in PowerShell.\n\n## Chocolatey `choco list` Command Output Format in PowerShell\n\nThe Chocolatey `choco list` command provides different output formats depending on the switches used.
