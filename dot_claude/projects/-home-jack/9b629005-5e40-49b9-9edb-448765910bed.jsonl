This contains all downloaded models and configuration files.\n\nOther important Ollama directories on Windows include:\n\n1. **Binaries**: Located at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\Ollama`, which the installer adds to your user PATH\n\n2. **Logs and Updates**: Found at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Ollama`, containing:\n   - app.log: Contains the most recent logs from the GUI application\n   - server.log: Holds the latest server logs\n\n3. **Temporary Files**: Located in `%TEMP%`, within one or more ollama* directories\n\n## Changing the Model Storage Location\n\nIf you need to change the location where models are stored, you can set the `OLLAMA_MODELS` environment variable to your desired directory.\n\nTo change the model storage location on Windows:\n\n1. Start the Settings (Windows 11) or Control Panel (Windows 10) application and search for environment variables. Click on Edit environment variables for your account\n\n2. Create a variable called `OLLAMA_MODELS` pointing to where you want to store the models\n\n3. Edit or create a new variable for your user account for `OLLAMA_MODELS` and click OK/Apply to save\n\nThis allows you to relocate your models to a different drive or directory, which can be helpful for managing disk space since model files can be quite large."}]},"uuid":"1b510ddd-0743-4207-afdb-3262719ce63e","timestamp":"2025-05-22T13:38:04.986Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"ollama model files location windows directory path","results":["I'll search for information about the Ollama model files location on Windows.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_013H66nByqX1ZohniMeRs2Nq","content":[{"title":"Ollama Model File Location | Restackio","url":"https://www.restack.io/p/ollama-answer-model-file-location-cat-ai"},{"title":"Can we change where the models are stored in windows · Issue #2551 · ollama/ollama","url":"https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/2551"},{"title":"ollama/docs/faq.md at main · ollama/ollama","url":"https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md"},{"title":"Ollama Install Location Windows | Restackio","url":"https://www.restack.io/p/ollama-answer-install-location-windows-cat-ai"},{"title":"How to Change Ollama Model Save Location on Windows: Step-by-Step Guide 2024 - SkillsFoster","url":"https://skillsfoster.com/change-model-save-location-for-ollama-on-windows/"},{"title":"Where Are Ollama Models Stored Mac | Restackio","url":"https://www.restack.io/p/ollama-models-storage-answer-cat-ai"},{"title":"Where is the default model download path in the Windows environment · Issue #3901 · ollama/ollama","url":"https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/3901"},{"title":"Relocating Ollama Models Folder in Windows","url":"https://www.igoroseledko.com/relocating-ollama-models-folder-in-windows/"},{"title":"Where Are Ollama Models Stored | Restackio","url":"https://www.restack.io/p/ollama-where-are-models-stored-answer-cat-ai"},{"title":"where is everything? · Issue #733 · ollama/ollama","url":"https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/733"}]},"Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Ollama model files location on Windows.\n\n## Default Ollama Model Files Location on Windows\n\nOn Windows, Ollama models are stored by default in `C:\\Users\\username\\.ollama` or specifically in the models subfolder at `C:\\Users\\%username%\\.ollama\\models`.\n\n## Key Directory Locations\n\nYou can access the models and configuration directory by pressing Win+R and entering: `explorer %HOMEPATH%\\.ollama`.
