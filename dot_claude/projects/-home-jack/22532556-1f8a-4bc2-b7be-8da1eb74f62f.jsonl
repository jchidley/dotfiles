As of March 2024, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance for open-source models of the same size class on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB).\n\nIn contrast, on the static MTEB Leaderboard, Nomic Embed ranks in the top 50s. However, on MTEB Arena, Nomic Embed ranks similarly to top-10 MTEB Leaderboard models that are 70x bigger.\n\n### Model Size and Parameters\n\nNomic Embed is the best performing 100M parameter class unsupervised model, while mxbai-embed-large-v1 has 335M parameters and is ranked at the 9th place on MTEB, being BERT-based with relatively smaller model size compared to LLM-based text embeddings.\n\n## Key Technical Differences\n\n### Training Approach\n\n**mxbai-embed-large-v1:**\n- Trained with over 700 million pairs using contrastive training and tuned on over 30 million high quality triplets using the AnglE loss\n- Uses AnglE loss technique and training was conducted on over 700 million pairs and fine-tuned on more than 30 million high-quality triplets\n\n**nomic-embed-text:**\n- Contrastive dataset is composed of ~235M text pairs\n- Training initialized with nomic-bert-2048\n\n### Context Length and Performance\n\nnomic-embed-text is a large context length text encoder that surpasses OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 and text-embedding-3-small performance on short and long context tasks. Nomic Embed also outperforms jina-embeddings-v2-base-en in aggregate on the Jina Long Context Benchmark.\n\n### Real-world Performance vs Benchmarks\n\nAn interesting finding is that the performance gap between Nomic Embed's static MTEB Leaderboard and dynamic MTEB Arena results raises an important question about whether larger models are overfitting the MTEB benchmark, as higher static MTEB Leaderboard scores may not fully capture a model's real-world performance.\n\n## Specific Use Cases\n\n### RAG Applications\n\nBoth models are designed for RAG applications, but users have reported mixed experiences. One user reported that self-hosted nomic-embed-text on ollama results were \"not so great\" with \"many mistakes\" when extracting data from invoices, suggesting potential limitations in certain practical applications.\n\n## Training Data Quality\n\nDuring mxbai-embed-large-v1's development, developers ensured zero overlap with tests of MTEB and went out of their way to not even use any training data from the MTEB (except MS Marco), unlike most other models, which may contribute to better generalization.\n\n## Summary\n\n**mxbai-embed-large-v1** appears to be the stronger performer overall:\n- Higher MTEB ranking (9th vs top 50s)\n- Larger parameter count (335M vs 100M) \n- More extensive training data (700M+ pairs vs 235M pairs)\n- Uses advanced AnglE loss technique\n\n**nomic-embed-text** excels in:\n- Long context tasks\n- Smaller model size (more efficient)\n- Strong performance in MTEB Arena (user preference evaluation)\n- Better real-world performance relative to model size\n\nThe choice between them may depend on your specific requirements: mxbai-embed-large-v1 for maximum performance, or nomic-embed-text for efficiency and long-context tasks."}]},"uuid":"5c73af43-5156-4819-8f4a-477ce50697ec","timestamp":"2025-05-22T17:05:28.102Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"nomic-embed-text vs mxbai-embed-large comparison embedding models","results":["I'll search for a comparison between the nomic-embed-text and mxbai-embed-large embedding models.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01JtCSv88bLjUTjxNGmHMN78","content":[{"title":"Nomic Blog: Introducing Nomic Embed: A Truly Open Embedding Model","url":"https://www.nomic.ai/blog/posts/nomic-embed-text-v1"},{"title":"mxbai-embed-large-v1 model | Clarifai - The World's AI","url":"https://clarifai.com/mixedbread-ai/embed/models/mxbai-embed-large-v1"},{"title":"mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1 · Hugging Face","url":"https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1"},{"title":"Open Source Strikes Bread - New Fluffy Embedding Model","url":"https://www.mixedbread.com/blog/mxbai-embed-large-v1"},{"title":"Can I use mxbai-embed-large embedding instead of nomic-embed-text for self hosted RAG? · danny-avila/LibreChat · Discussion #3767","url":"https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/discussions/3767"},{"title":"nomic-embed-text","url":"https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text"},{"title":"Finding the Best Open-Source Embedding Model for RAG | Timescale","url":"https://www.timescale.com/blog/finding-the-best-open-source-embedding-model-for-rag"},{"title":"mxbai-embed-large embedding not consistent with original ...","url":"https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/4207"},{"title":"OpenAI vs. Open-source: Embedding Model Showdown - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/timescale/openai-vs-open-source-embedding-model-showdown-189n"},{"title":"Comparing AI embedding models – Geir’s notes","url":"https://geirfreysson.com/posts/2025-01-25-comparing-embedding-models/index.html"}]},"Let me search for more specific benchmark comparisons between these two models.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01UyzuPPzcpi7XSmsJeomjSq","content":[{"title":"Nomic Blog: Nomic Embed's Surprisingly Good MTEB Arena Elo Score","url":"https://www.nomic.ai/blog/posts/evaluating-embedding-models"},{"title":"Nomic Blog: Introducing Nomic Embed: A Truly Open Embedding Model","url":"https://www.nomic.ai/blog/posts/nomic-embed-text-v1"},{"title":"mxbai-embed-large-v1 model | Clarifai - The World's AI","url":"https://clarifai.com/mixedbread-ai/embed/models/mxbai-embed-large-v1"},{"title":"Recent advances in text embedding: A Comprehensive Review of Top-Performing Methods on the MTEB Benchmark","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01607v1"},{"title":"Open Source Strikes Bread - New Fluffy Embedding Model","url":"https://www.mixedbread.com/blog/mxbai-embed-large-v1"},{"title":"MTEB: Massive Text Embedding Benchmark","url":"https://huggingface.co/blog/mteb"},{"title":"mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1 · Hugging Face","url":"https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1"},{"title":"Top embedding models on the MTEB leaderboard | Modal Blog","url":"https://modal.com/blog/mteb-leaderboard-article"},{"title":"NVIDIA Text Embedding Model Tops MTEB Leaderboard | NVIDIA Technical Blog","url":"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-text-embedding-model-tops-mteb-leaderboard/"},{"title":"[2210.07316] MTEB: Massive Text Embedding Benchmark","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07316"}]},"Based on my search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive comparison between nomic-embed-text and mxbai-embed-large embedding models:\n\n## Performance Comparison\n\n### MTEB Benchmark Performance\n\nmxbai-embed-large-v1 is ranked first among embedding models of similar size and outperforms OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model and matches the performance of models 20 times its size, such as echo-mistral-7b.
