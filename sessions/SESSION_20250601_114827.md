# Session Log: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Date: 2025-06-01
Duration: ~20 minutes

## Summary
Enhanced the checkpoint and wrap-session commands with a sophisticated interactive tool permission management system. This eliminates the friction of manually approving each tool request in future sessions by automatically tracking and bulk-approving permissions.

## Key Accomplishments
- Implemented interactive permission approval in /checkpoint command
- Implemented interactive permission approval in /wrap-session command  
- Created .claude/settings.local.json with approved tool permissions
- Successfully tested the new checkpoint workflow with real tool usage

## Technical Insights
The enhanced permission system tracks ALL tool usage (both allowed and denied), provides an interactive approval interface (Accept all/Modify/Skip), and automatically updates the settings file. This is a significant improvement over the previous suggestion-only approach.

## Challenges Encountered
None - implementation went smoothly

## Files Modified
- dot_claude/commands/checkpoint.md
- dot_claude/commands/wrap-session.md
- HANDOFF.md
- dot_claude/settings.local.json (new file)

## Next Session Priority
Test the enhanced wrap-session command and verify the settings.local.json permissions work as expected in a new session
