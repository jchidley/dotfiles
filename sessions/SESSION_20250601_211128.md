# Session 20250601_211128
Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles

## Work Done
- Investigated why chezmoi apply wasn't updating .claude directory files
- Discovered .claude/ was being ignored in .chezmoiignore
- Updated .chezmoiignore to allow managing .claude config while ignoring runtime data (todos/, statsig/, projects/, etc.)
- Successfully applied chezmoi changes to sync wrap-session.md and other config files

## Failed Approaches
None - straightforward fix once the root cause was identified

## Commits
No commits made during this session (configuration troubleshooting only)
