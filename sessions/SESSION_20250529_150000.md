# Session Log: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Date: 2025-05-29
Duration: ~1 hour

## Summary
Refactored all Claude slash commands to separate documentation from execution instructions. Created a centralized COMMANDS.md file for human-readable documentation while ensuring command files contain only pure execution instructions for Claude.

## Key Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive COMMANDS.md documentation for all slash commands
- Refactored 8 major command files to remove explanatory text
- Standardized command structure across all files
- Documented commands without metadata as "Author: Unknown, Created: 2025-05-01"

## Technical Insights
The separation of documentation from execution creates cleaner, more maintainable commands. Command files now serve as pure instruction sets for Claude, while COMMANDS.md provides the context and usage information for humans.

## Challenges Encountered
None - the refactoring was straightforward once the pattern was established.

## Files Modified
- dot_claude/COMMANDS.md (new)
- dot_claude/commands/start.md
- dot_claude/commands/checkpoint.md
- dot_claude/commands/wrap-session.md
- dot_claude/commands/tool.md
- dot_claude/commands/req.md
- dot_claude/commands/req-to-issue.md
- dot_claude/commands/plan.md
- dot_claude/commands/setup.md

## Next Session Priority
Test the refactored commands to ensure they execute correctly, particularly /start, /checkpoint, and /wrap-session which are critical for session management.
