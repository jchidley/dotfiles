# Session Log: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Date: 2025-06-01
Duration: ~90 minutes

## Summary
Comprehensively improved the session management commands to proactively capture PROJECT_WISDOM.md insights and enhanced tool permission tracking. Fixed the issue where important discoveries were being missed by providing specific patterns and interactive prompts.

## Key Accomplishments
- Enhanced /checkpoint with proactive PROJECT_WISDOM.md suggestions and patterns
- Enhanced /wrap-session with explicit insight review process
- Added insight capture reminder to /start command
- Successfully tested full checkpoint/wrap workflow with permission tracking
- Captured multiple insights about command design and tool permissions

## Technical Insights
Commands work better with specific examples and patterns rather than vague criteria like "significant discovery". Interactive prompts with concrete suggestions dramatically improve capture rates.

## Challenges Encountered
Initial PROJECT_WISDOM.md wasn't being created/updated because the conditional logic was too buried and vague. Fixed by making it explicit and proactive.
