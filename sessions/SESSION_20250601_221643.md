## Overview
Enhanced checkpoint and wrap-session commands to properly handle multiple checkpoints without data loss.

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed wrap-session.md checkpoint handling
- **Issue**: wrap-session was deleting checkpoint files before reading their content
- **Solution**: Changed the logic to read SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md content before deletion
- **Key change**: Modified the conditional logic from "otherwise" to "and" to ensure content is incorporated

### 2. Updated checkpoint file naming strategy
- **Issue**: Multiple checkpoints in a session would overwrite each other
- **Solution**: checkpoint.md now creates timestamped files: `SESSION_CHECKPOINT_[HHMMSS].md`
- **Benefit**: Allows multiple checkpoints during a session without data loss

### 3. Enhanced wrap-session to handle multiple checkpoints
- **Enhancement**: wrap-session now finds and incorporates ALL SESSION_*.md files in root
- **Implementation**: Uses glob pattern to find all checkpoint files
- **Result**: No checkpoint data is lost during session wrap-up

## Key Insights

1. **Multiple checkpoints need unique filenames**: The original design assumed one checkpoint per session, but users may checkpoint multiple times. Timestamped filenames prevent overwriting.

2. **Order of operations matters**: Reading checkpoint content must happen before deletion to prevent data loss.

3. **Glob patterns improve robustness**: Using `SESSION_*.md` pattern instead of a specific filename makes the system more flexible and catches all checkpoints.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/home/jack/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_claude/commands/checkpoint.md`
- `/home/jack/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_claude/commands/wrap-session.md`

### Testing Considerations
- Both commands now handle edge cases:
  - No checkpoint files present
  - Single checkpoint file
  - Multiple checkpoint files
  - Empty checkpoint files

## Next Steps
The checkpoint/wrap-session system is now more robust and can handle multiple checkpoints without data loss. Consider future enhancements:
- Add checkpoint metadata (why the checkpoint was created)
- Implement checkpoint consolidation for very long sessions
- Add option to list/review existing checkpoints before wrap-up
