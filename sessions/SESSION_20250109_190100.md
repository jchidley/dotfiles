# Session 20250109_190100
Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles

## Work Done
- Analyzed tools/CLAUDE.md and dot_claude/CLAUDE.md to identify enforceable invariants for claude-hooks
- Created comprehensive implementation plan for expanding claude-hooks in 3 phases
- Deduplicated tools/CLAUDE.md by removing ~126 lines that belong in global config or hooks
- Created cleaned version of tools/CLAUDE.md focusing on philosophy and complex patterns
- Consolidated multiple analysis documents into single comprehensive plan
- Established clear separation of concerns: global rules → hooks → philosophy

## Key Documents Created
- wip-claude/20250109_183000_claude_hooks_comprehensive_plan.md - Master implementation plan
- wip-claude/20250109_184500_tools_claude_md_deduplication_analysis.md - What to remove/keep
- wip-claude/20250109_185000_tools_claude_md_cleaned.md - Cleaned CLAUDE.md (~160 lines)
