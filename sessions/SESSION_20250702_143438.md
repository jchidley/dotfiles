# Session 20250702_143438
Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles

## Work Done
- Reviewed git diff showing updates to checkpoint.md and wrap-session.md commands
- Examined new wisdom capture system with CURRENT_PROJECT_WISDOM.md
- Discovered wisdom patterns were already extracted to wisdom-triggers.md
- Applied chezmoi changes to deploy the new command structure
- Verified the refactoring that:
  - Eliminated duplication between checkpoint.md and wrap-session.md
  - Created central wisdom-triggers.md for pattern definitions
  - Added /clean-wisdom for pattern distillation through repetition analysis
  - Added /wisdom for applying refined patterns to tasks

## Failed Approaches
None - the wisdom command refactoring was already completed
