## Summary
Added refactoring discipline documentation to the chezmoi dotfiles repository. Created REFACTORING_RULES.md and REFACTORING_EXPLAINED.md to establish strict guidelines for safe refactoring practices, and updated CLAUDE.md to reference these new documents.

## Changes Made
1. Added REFACTORING_RULES.md - Strict mechanical refactoring guidelines
2. Added REFACTORING_EXPLAINED.md - Detailed explanation of why these rules matter
3. Updated dot_claude/CLAUDE.md with new "Refactoring Discipline" section
4. Committed and pushed all changes
5. Applied changes with chezmoi

## Key Decisions
