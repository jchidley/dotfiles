Date: 2025-05-31
Duration: ~5 minutes

## Summary
Brief follow-up session to add todos for checking TODO.md usage and PROJECT_WISDOM.md handling when the file doesn't exist.

## Key Accomplishments
- Added todo items for investigating TODO.md usage in commands
- Added todo for checking PROJECT_WISDOM.md creation behavior
- Confirmed session wrap workflow works without checkpoint

## Technical Insights
The /wrap-session command works independently of /checkpoint, confirming the design allows flexible session endings.

## Next Session Priority
1. Check TODO.md usage across all commands
2. Verify PROJECT_WISDOM.md creation handling
3. Commit all pending session management changes
