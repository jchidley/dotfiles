# Session 20250604_150648
Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles

## Work Done
- Analyzed todo list persistence issue where Claude's todo list can be lost between sessions
- Updated checkpoint.md to include todo list capture in HANDOFF.md
- Updated wrap-session.md to include todo list capture in HANDOFF.md  
- Updated start.md with intelligent merge strategy for combining existing and restored todos
- Enhanced HANDOFF.md template with Active Todo List section
- Documented the merge strategy in PROJECT_WISDOM.md
- Committed and pushed changes to git
- Applied changes with chezmoi

## Failed Approaches
None - all implementations worked as designed

## Commits
6eb8a27 feat: add todo list persistence to session management commands

## Technical Insights
- Todo List Persistence: Implemented smart merge strategy that preserves both current session todos and recovered HANDOFF.md todos, using status hierarchy (completed > in_progress > pending) to resolve conflicts
- Merge Logic: Never duplicates by content, preserves all current todos, and prevents status regression
