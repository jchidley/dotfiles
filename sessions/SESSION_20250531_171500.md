# Session Log: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Date: 2025-05-31
Duration: ~45 minutes

## Summary
Redesigned session management commands to eliminate duplication and create a clear human-AI collaboration workflow. Each file now has a single, well-defined purpose, and gentle reminders help optimize the symbiotic relationship.

## Key Accomplishments
- Simplified /checkpoint to create minimal SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md (3 lines only)
- Updated /wrap-session to use sessions/ directory for archives
- Created WORKING_WITH_CLAUDE.md guide for human-side collaboration patterns

## Technical Insights
The key to avoiding repeated mistakes isn't more automation - it's better human-AI collaboration. By documenting "magic phrases" and reminding humans when to guide AI searches, we leverage each partner's strengths.

## Challenges Encountered
Initial over-simplification removed useful PROJECT_WISDOM.md archiving functionality - restored after recognizing it serves a different purpose than session management.

## Files Modified
- dot_claude/commands/checkpoint.md
- dot_claude/commands/start.md  
- dot_claude/commands/wrap-session.md
- HANDOFF.md
- SESSION_MANAGEMENT_WORKFLOW.md (created)
- WORKING_WITH_CLAUDE.md (created)
- sessions/ directory (created and populated)

## Next Session Priority
Test the new workflow with real development work to see if collaboration patterns effectively prevent repetition of past mistakes.
