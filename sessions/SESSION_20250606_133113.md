## Session Summary

This session focused on enhancing the CLAUDE.md documentation with new sections for documentation workflow and Rust-specific refactoring guidance. The session successfully implemented a temporary documentation strategy using the wip-claude folder and documented this approach in PROJECT_WISDOM.md.

## Work Completed

### 1. Enhanced CLAUDE.md Documentation (Priority: High) ✓
- Added new "Documentation & Planning" section
- Documented the wip-claude folder usage for temporary documentation
- Established clear workflow for documentation development

### 2. Extended Refactoring Discipline (Priority: High) ✓
- Added Rust-specific guidance to the Refactoring Discipline section
- Referenced the comprehensive Rust refactoring documentation files
- Maintained consistency with existing refactoring rules

### 3. Created wip-claude Infrastructure (Priority: Medium) ✓
- Created wip-claude folder structure
- Added explanatory README.md with usage guidelines
- Set up proper .gitignore to exclude temporary files

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Documentation Strategy**: Established wip-claude as the designated folder for temporary documentation development, separate from the main project structure.

2. **Rust Refactoring Integration**: Decided to reference existing Rust refactoring documentation rather than duplicate content, maintaining DRY principles.

3. **Workflow Documentation**: Documented the temporary documentation workflow in PROJECT_WISDOM.md to preserve institutional knowledge.

## Notes for Next Session

The wip-claude folder is now available for temporary documentation development. Any Claude-generated documentation drafts should be placed there first for review before being moved to their final locations.

The Rust refactoring guidance is now integrated into CLAUDE.md, ensuring that any Rust refactoring work follows the established discipline and best practices documented in the RUST_REFACTORING_*.md files.
