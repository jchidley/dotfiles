# Session 20250602_072650
Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles

## Work Done
- Analyzed why /req commands weren't working effectively
- Discovered commands were written as instructions to Claude (correct) but lacked detail
- Rewrote /req command from 30 sparse lines to ~200 detailed instructions
- Simplified /req usage to natural pattern: `/req <description>` (removed unnecessary subcommands)
- Added intelligent duplicate/relationship detection for existing requirements
- Integrated automatic GitHub issue creation when in GitHub repositories
- Added ability to append details to existing requirements via GitHub comments or REQUIREMENTS.md
- Enhanced /req-to-issue with comprehensive error handling and prerequisite checks
- Updated CLAUDE.md documentation to reflect simplified usage
- Analyzed all other issue-related commands to confirm no overlap

## Key Improvements
1. **Natural Usage**: `/req <description>` just works - no need to think about subcommands
2. **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects related requirements and offers to add detail
3. **GitHub Integration**: Creates issues automatically when possible
4. **Detailed Instructions**: Commands now have explicit step-by-step logic like successful commands

## Failed Approaches
- Initially kept complex subcommand structure (check/add) - removed per user feedback
- Started with simple duplicate detection - evolved to smarter relationship detection

## Technical Insights
- Claude Code slash commands work by displaying instructions that Claude reads and executes
- Command effectiveness directly correlates with instruction detail (30 lines â†’ 200 lines)
- Users prefer natural command patterns over explicit subcommands
- Smart defaults (auto-create GitHub issues) reduce friction significantly
