# Session Log - 2025-06-01 21:46:01

## Session Summary

### Work Completed
- Reviewed .chezmoiignore file and explained the effect of each non-comment line
- Identified that the file allows chezmoi to manage .claude configuration while excluding runtime data

### Key Insights
- The .chezmoiignore file uses gitignore syntax to control which files chezmoi manages
- Patterns like `dot_claude/sessions/` exclude runtime/temporary data while allowing static configuration
- The file properly balances between managing important configs and excluding generated content

### Changes Made
- No files were modified during this session (review only)

### Context for Next Session
The .chezmoiignore file is properly configured to:
1. Manage .claude configuration files while excluding session data
2. Exclude OS-specific and temporary files
3. Ignore various log and cache directories
4. Handle platform-specific paths (Windows AppData, etc.)
