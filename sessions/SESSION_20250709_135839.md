# Session 20250709_135839
Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles

## Work Done
- Implemented Phase 2 test quality validators to detect ineffective test patterns (OCR 0% problem)
- Enhanced bash script validators with completeness checks (IFS, DEBUG, test flags, bats tests)
- Created comprehensive test suite for Phase 2 validators (all tests passing)
- Attempted /wrap-session refactoring but reverted (adding references increased line count)
- Successfully simplified /req command from 263 to 101 lines by extracting GitHub issue template
- Fixed timestamps in recent wip-claude documents to match actual creation dates
- Applied chezmoi changes to deploy updates
