# Session 20250702_154500
Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles

## Work Done
- Fixed directory-unsafe session management commands by adding explicit cd to project root
- Updated 7 commands (/checkpoint, /wrap-session, /req, /req-to-issue, /clean-wisdom, /wisdom, /start) 
- Cleaned up documentation clutter while preserving essential instructions
- Performed wisdom distillation with /clean-wisdom command:
  - Analyzed 25+ session files spanning 2025-01-06 to 2025-07-02  
  - Created refined PROJECT_WISDOM.md with 3 CORE patterns, 4 established patterns, 2 emerging patterns
  - Archived previous CURRENT_PROJECT_WISDOM.md content
- Updated Chezmoi Source File Discipline pattern to distinguish human vs Claude tooling approaches
- Captured new Working Directory Management pattern as CORE pattern

## Failed Approaches
None - all directory fixes were successful and wisdom distillation completed without issues

## Commits
7cc76b5 refactor: update /start and /wisdom commands for streamlined workflow
(No new commits during this session - changes were to command definitions)

## Technical Insights
- Session management commands were vulnerable to creating files in wrong locations if Claude navigated to subdirectories
- Working directory independence requires explicit cd instructions using environment working directory
- Pattern distillation revealed Working Directory Management as a CORE pattern (6+ occurrences)
- Chezmoi source file discipline applies to both humans and Claude but with different tooling approaches
