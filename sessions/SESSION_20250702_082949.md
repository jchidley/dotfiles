# Session 20250702_082949
Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles

## Work Done
- Updated Windows Terminal commands in dotfiles:
  - Modified `dot_bashrc.tmpl` to change `wt.exe -w 0 ft -t 0 sp -V -p "Debian"` to use `-t 1` instead
  - Modified `bash_shell_hints` to change both wt.exe commands from `-t 0` to `-t 1`
  - Added new Windows Terminal command line to `ps_shell_hints`: `wt -w 0 -p "Debian" `; wt -w 0 ft -t 1 sp -V -p "Debian"`
  - Added same Windows Terminal command to PowerShell profile after the `get-content ~/ps_shell_hints` line
