# Session 20250103_112750
Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles

## Work Done
- Reviewed latest Claude Code features and documentation
- Updated slash commands to support new $ARGUMENTS placeholder:
  - /req command now uses $ARGUMENTS for flexible requirement handling
  - /plan command can specify project details via arguments
  - /security-review can target specific directories/patterns
  - /gh-issue can pass issue numbers directly
- Restructured CLAUDE.md files to eliminate redundancy:
  - Removed built-in commands list from project CLAUDE.md
  - Moved built-in commands documentation to COMMANDS.md
  - Removed non-functional @import syntax from global CLAUDE.md
- Applied changes with chezmoi and committed to repository

## Key Decisions
- Keep CLAUDE.md files focused on direct Claude instructions only
- Move all documentation to appropriate files (COMMANDS.md for command docs)
- Use $ARGUMENTS placeholder for flexible command usage

## Commits
71d79a9 refactor: clean up CLAUDE.md structure and remove redundancy

## Next Steps
- Test the updated commands with real usage
- Consider adding $ARGUMENTS to more commands that could benefit
- Monitor for any new Claude Code features in future releases
