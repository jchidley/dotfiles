# Session 20250630_190954
Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles

## Work Done
- Found and removed TODO.md references throughout the codebase (9 tasks completed)
- Updated CLAUDE.md files to remove redundant planning mode instructions
- Restored missing bash safety rules to tools/CLAUDE.md
- Analyzed and removed 13 unused commands following minimal philosophy
- Updated COMMANDS.md reducing from 20 to 9 essential commands
- Created new /standards command to check project compliance with CLAUDE.md standards

## Failed Approaches
- Initially edited ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md directly instead of chezmoi source file
- Attempted to apply all chezmoi changes at once causing TTY error with .bashrc

## Commits
- No commits made during this session (user did not request commits)

## Technical Insights
- Claude Code's built-in planning mode makes custom planning commands redundant
- TodoRead/TodoWrite provide in-memory todo management during sessions
- HANDOFF.md still necessary for cross-session todo persistence
- Chezmoi source files must be edited, not deployed files
- Minimal command set philosophy: remove unused functionality
