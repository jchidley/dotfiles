# Session 20250105_141523
Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles

## Work Done
- Reviewed all git changes in CURRENT_PROJECT_WISDOM.md, CLAUDE.md files, and command files
- Added PowerShell script requirements to dot_claude/CLAUDE.md for WSL integration
- Added instructions to avoid color and unicode in bash/PowerShell scripts in tools/CLAUDE.md
- Redesigned /checkpoint, /wrap-session, and /start commands for minimal context usage:
  - /checkpoint now creates minimal CHECKPOINT.md safety net
  - /wrap-session writes checkpoint first, reorders by context impact
  - /start checks for CHECKPOINT.md to recover from interrupted sessions
- Applied chezmoi changes to propagate updates
