  sessions in dot_claude/commands/wrap-session.md

‚óè I'll add that task to our todo list.

‚óè Added task to check the /export command. This will help us understand if there's overlap or
  complementary functionality between /export and our wrap-session approach.

> let's start a sub-agent to "Check /export command and compare with wrap-session functionality" that 
  needs to think about the problem and write a document with what it finds and a plan

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  The user wants me to launch a sub-agent to investigate the /export command and compare it with 
  wrap-session functionality. This is a research/analysis task that should result in a document with 
  findings and a plan.

  I'll use the Task tool to launch an agent that will:
  1. Look at the /export command implementation
  2. Look at the wrap-session command
  3. Compare their functionality
  4. Write a document with findings and recommendations

  I should mark the todo as in_progress before launching the agent.

‚óè I'll mark this task as in progress and launch a sub-agent to investigate the /export command and

‚óè Update Todos

     ‚òê Update /start command to handle CHECKPOINT.md recovery

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Now I'll create a detailed prompt for the sub-agent that asks it to:
  1. Find and read the /export command implementation
  2. Find and read the wrap-session command implementation
  3. Compare their functionality
  4. Write a comprehensive analysis document
  5. Include recommendations for whether we need both, should merge them, or keep them separate

> let's start a sub-agent to "Check /export command and compare with the session functionality of the 
  dot_claude/commands/wrap-session.md" that needs to think about the problem and write a document with 
  what it finds and a plan

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  The user wants me to launch a sub-agent to investigate the /export command and compare it with the 
  session functionality in wrap-session.md. I should clarify the task for the agent to focus on the 
  session-related aspects of wrap-session, not the entire command.

‚óè I'll launch a sub-agent to analyze the /export command and compare it specifically with the session
  functionality of wrap-session.

‚óè Task(Analyze /export vs wrap-session sessions)
  ‚éø ¬†Done (13 tool uses ¬∑ 24.5k tokens ¬∑ 2m 47.5s)                                                     

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  The agent discovered that there's no /export command in the codebase. This is interesting - the user 
  might have been thinking about a potential command or confused about existing functionality. The 
  agent did a good job analyzing what an /export command could do and how it would complement 
  wrap-session.

  I should update the todo to reflect this finding and let the user know about the analysis.

‚óè Interesting finding - there's no /export command in the codebase! The agent created a thorough
  analysis document showing that wrap-session handles session management, but a potential /export
  command could serve a complementary purpose for knowledge extraction and sharing.

‚óè Update Todos
  ‚éø ¬†‚òí Check /export command and compare with wrap-session functionality
     ‚òê Update /start command to handle CHECKPOINT.md recovery
     ‚òê Archive superseded wip-claude documents

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Now I should provide a brief summary to the user of what was found, highlighting the key insight that
   /export doesn't exist but could be a useful addition.

‚óè The analysis revealed that /export doesn't exist in your codebase. The agent documented how a future
  /export command could complement /wrap-session by focusing on knowledge extraction and conversation
  export, while wrap-session continues handling operational session management.
