# Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Updated: 2025-06-01 22:16

## Current State
Status: Enhanced checkpoint/wrap-session commands for robust multi-checkpoint handling
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration with robust scripting standards
Latest: Checkpoint commands now support multiple checkpoints without data loss

## Essential Context
- **RESOLVED**: Checkpoint/wrap-session now handle multiple checkpoints properly
- Checkpoint creates timestamped files: SESSION_CHECKPOINT_[HHMMSS].md
- Wrap-session reads all SESSION_*.md files before deletion (no data loss)
- dot_claude properly transforms to ~/.claude without nested subdirectories
- Single settings.local.json in dot_claude/ with full permissions
- .chezmoiignore properly excludes runtime data while managing static configs
- Runtime directories excluded: .claude/todos/, statsig/, projects/, local/, .credentials.json
- Commands proactively suggest insights with concrete examples
- Tool permissions fully automated with interactive approval UI
- Documentation organized: AI context in .claude/, development guides in tools/

## Next Step
Consider adding checkpoint metadata or consolidation features for long sessions

## If Blocked
None - system fully operational
