# Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Updated: 2025-01-03 11:27

## Current State
Status: Claude Code commands updated for latest features and CLAUDE.md cleaned up
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration with robust scripting standards
Latest: Commands support $ARGUMENTS placeholder and CLAUDE.md structure improved

## Essential Context
- Claude Code commands updated to use $ARGUMENTS placeholder for flexibility
- CLAUDE.md files restructured - removed redundancy and @import syntax
- Built-in commands documented in COMMANDS.md (not CLAUDE.md)
- All session management commands remain fully compatible
- Chezmoi file transformations working correctly (dot_ â†’ .)

## Next Step
Test updated commands with real usage to verify $ARGUMENTS handling

## If Blocked
None - system fully operational
