# Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Updated: 2025-05-29

## Current State
Status: Refactored all slash commands - documentation separated from execution
Target: Clean command structure with centralized documentation
Latest: Created COMMANDS.md and refactored 8 command files to pure execution instructions

## Essential Context
- Created `dot_claude/COMMANDS.md` for human-readable slash command documentation
- Refactored command files to contain only execution instructions for Claude
- Commands without metadata marked as "Author: Unknown, Created: 2025-05-01"
- Major refactors: /start, /checkpoint, /wrap-session, /tool, /req, /req-to-issue, /plan, /setup
- Command files now follow consistent pattern: pure instructions, no explanatory text

## Next Step
Test refactored commands to ensure they execute correctly
