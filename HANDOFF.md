## Current State
Status: Session management fully implemented with PROJECT_WISDOM.md integration
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration with robust scripting standards
Latest: PROJECT_WISDOM.md now searchable by Claude with consistent handling

## Essential Context
- WORKING_WITH_CLAUDE.md guides human-side of preventing repeated mistakes
- PROJECT_WISDOM.md captures searchable insights (Topic - Discovery format)
- Tool usage checks in /checkpoint and /wrap-session for settings.local.json
- sessions/ directory contains all historical logs
- Each file has ONE clear purpose - no duplication

## Next Step
Test full session workflow with real development tasks to validate design

## Failed Approaches
None documented yet - new feature just added
