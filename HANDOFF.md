# Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Updated: 2025-07-02 14:34

## Current State
Status: Wisdom command system refactored with centralized patterns
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration with robust scripting standards
Latest: Extracted wisdom capture patterns to wisdom-triggers.md, added /clean-wisdom and /wisdom commands

## Essential Context
- Removed 13 unused commands following minimal philosophy
- Claude Code's built-in planning and todo features replace custom implementations
- HANDOFF.md todo persistence still necessary for cross-session continuity
- All CLAUDE.md files updated to reflect native Claude Code features
- New /standards command checks project compliance with all standards
- Windows Terminal commands now properly echo as hints in PowerShell
- Wisdom capture patterns centralized in wisdom-triggers.md (DRY principle)
- New commands: /clean-wisdom (pattern distillation), /wisdom (pattern application)

## Next Step
Continue with any other dotfiles improvements or maintenance tasks

## Active Todo List
[✓] Update wt.exe command in dot_bashrc.tmpl from -t 0 to -t 1
[✓] Update wt.exe command in bash_shell_hints from -t 0 to -t 1

## If Blocked
None - system fully operational
