# Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Updated: 2025-07-02 15:45

## Current State
Status: Session commands made directory-independent, wisdom patterns distilled
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration with robust scripting standards
Latest: Fixed 7 session management commands to work from any directory, distilled 25+ sessions into refined patterns

## Essential Context
- Removed 13 unused commands following minimal philosophy
- Claude Code's built-in planning and todo features replace custom implementations
- HANDOFF.md todo persistence still necessary for cross-session continuity
- All CLAUDE.md files updated to reflect native Claude Code features
- New /standards command checks project compliance with all standards
- Windows Terminal commands now properly echo as hints in PowerShell
- Wisdom capture patterns centralized in wisdom-triggers.md (DRY principle)
- New commands: /clean-wisdom (pattern distillation), /wisdom (pattern application)

## Next Step
Continue with any other dotfiles improvements or maintenance tasks
