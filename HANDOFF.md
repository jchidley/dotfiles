## Current State
Status: Simplified session management commands for minimal context usage
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration with robust scripting standards
Latest: Updated session management commands for minimal context usage

## Essential Context
- Removed 13 unused commands following minimal philosophy
- Claude Code's built-in planning and todo features replace custom implementations
- HANDOFF.md todo persistence still necessary for cross-session continuity
- All CLAUDE.md files updated to reflect native Claude Code features
- New /standards command checks project compliance with all standards
- Windows Terminal commands now properly echo as hints in PowerShell
- Wisdom capture patterns centralized in wisdom-triggers.md (DRY principle)
- New commands: /clean-wisdom (pattern distillation), /wisdom (pattern application)
- /checkpoint now creates minimal CHECKPOINT.md safety net
- /wrap-session writes checkpoint first for resilience to context limits

## Next Step
Commit the session management improvements

## Active Todo List
