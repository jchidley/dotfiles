# Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Updated: 2025-06-30 19:09

## Current State
Status: Streamlined command set to 9 essential commands, added standards compliance checking
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration with robust scripting standards
Latest: Created /standards command to verify CLAUDE.md compliance across projects

## Essential Context
- Removed 13 unused commands following minimal philosophy
- Claude Code's built-in planning and todo features replace custom implementations
- HANDOFF.md todo persistence still necessary for cross-session continuity
- All CLAUDE.md files updated to reflect native Claude Code features
- New /standards command checks project compliance with all standards

## Next Step
Use /standards command to audit projects for CLAUDE.md compliance

## Active Todo List
No active todos

## If Blocked
