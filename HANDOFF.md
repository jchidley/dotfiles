Updated: 2025-06-01 10:31

## Current State
Status: Enhanced tool permission management system implemented
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration with robust scripting standards
Latest: Upgraded /checkpoint and /wrap-session with interactive permission approval

## Essential Context
- Tool permission system now tracks ALL usage (allowed + denied)
- Interactive approval process: Accept all, Modify, or Skip
- Automatic .claude/settings.local.json updates eliminate manual approvals
- WORKING_WITH_CLAUDE.md guides human-side collaboration
- PROJECT_WISDOM.md captures searchable insights (Topic - Discovery format)

## Next Step
Test the enhanced checkpoint command with real tool permissions

## If Blocked
None - system ready for testing
