# Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Updated: 2025-06-04 15:06

## Current State
Status: Todo list persistence implemented across all session management commands
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration with robust scripting standards
Latest: Smart merge strategy prevents todo loss between sessions

## Essential Context
- Todo list now persists in HANDOFF.md with intelligent merge on restoration
- Session commands use TodoRead/TodoWrite for reliable todo tracking
- Merge strategy: preserves progress, prevents duplicates, recovers lost todos
- Status hierarchy: completed > in_progress > pending (never regress)
- All changes committed, pushed, and applied with chezmoi

## Next Step
Monitor todo persistence in real usage to verify merge logic works correctly

## Active Todo List
- [✓] Design todo list merge strategy for start.md
- [✓] Update start.md with merge logic
- [✓] Add merge conflict examples to commands

## If Blocked
None - system fully operational
