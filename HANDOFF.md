# Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Updated: 2025-07-02 17:11

## Current State
Status: Enhanced /clean-wisdom with cross-project analysis capabilities
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration with robust scripting standards
Latest: Added cross-project analysis prompt to /clean-wisdom command for multi-directory pattern discovery

## Essential Context
- Removed 13 unused commands following minimal philosophy
- Claude Code's built-in planning and todo features replace custom implementations
- HANDOFF.md todo persistence still necessary for cross-session continuity
- All CLAUDE.md files updated to reflect native Claude Code features
- New /standards command checks project compliance with all standards
- Windows Terminal commands now properly echo as hints in PowerShell
- Wisdom capture patterns centralized in wisdom-triggers.md (DRY principle)
- New commands: /clean-wisdom (pattern distillation), /wisdom (pattern application)

## Next Step
Continue with any other dotfiles improvements or maintenance tasks

## Active Todo List
[âœ“] Add cross-project analysis prompt to /clean-wisdom command

## If Blocked
None - system fully operational
