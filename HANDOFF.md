## Current State
Status: Session management redesigned with human-AI collaboration patterns
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration with robust scripting standards
Latest: Completed session workflow redesign - ready for real-world testing

## Essential Context
- WORKING_WITH_CLAUDE.md guides human-side of preventing repeated mistakes
- SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md enables mid-session compaction (3 lines only)
- sessions/ directory contains all historical logs
- Each file has ONE clear purpose - no duplication
- Bash scripts require error handling, debug mode, and testing support

## Next Step
Check TODO.md usage and PROJECT_WISDOM.md creation, then commit all changes

## Failed Approaches
None documented yet - new feature just added
