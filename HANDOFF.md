## Current State
Status: Command quality improved, HANDOFF streamlined
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles with comprehensive hook-based enforcement
Latest: Cleaned commands, extracted patterns, simplified HANDOFF.md

## Essential Context

- Removed 2 non-functional commands
- Created command references/ directory for shared patterns
- HANDOFF.md simplified to focus on current work only

## Next Step
Continue Phase 2 hook implementations for test quality validation

## Active Todo List
- [ ] Implement Phase 2: Test quality validators
- [ ] Implement Phase 2: Bash script completeness validators
- [ ] Implement Phase 3: Documentation patterns and other validators

## If Blocked
None - system fully operational
