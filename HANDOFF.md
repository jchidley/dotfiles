## Current State
Status: Enhanced /req commands for GitHub integration
Target: Full requirement tracking with detailed GitHub issues
Latest: Updated /req and /req-to-issue commands

## Essential Context
- Fixed /req command to execute properly instead of just showing documentation
- Enhanced /req add to include proper format and GitHub reminder
- Updated /req-to-issue with detailed implementation template
- Added comprehensive GitHub issue body template with:
  - Design decisions tracking
  - Technical notes sections
  - Progress tracking checklists
  - Testing strategy sections
  - Documentation requirements

## Next Step
1. Test /req add with a sample requirement
2. Test /req-to-issue to create GitHub issue with detailed notes
3. Verify GitHub issue includes all implementation sections
