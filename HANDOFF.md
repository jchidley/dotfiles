# Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Updated: 2025-05-30 00:57

## Current State
Status: Development standards enhanced with bash script requirements
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration with robust scripting standards
Latest: Added comprehensive bash script testing and debugging standards to tools/CLAUDE.md

## Essential Context
- Removed 124 Claude runtime files from repository
- CLAUDE.md files reduced to essential configuration only
- Documentation moved to CLAUDE_METHODOLOGY.md
- Session commands now document failed approaches to avoid repeating dead ends
- Bash scripts now require error handling, debug mode, and testing support

## Next Step
Monitor adoption of new bash script standards and ensure compliance in future scripts

## Failed Approaches
None documented yet - new feature just added
