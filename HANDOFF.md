# Project: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Updated: 2025-05-29 22:38

## Current State
Status: Session commands enhanced with failure tracking
Target: Clean, minimal dotfiles configuration
Latest: Added failed approaches documentation to checkpoint and wrap-session commands

## Essential Context
- Removed 124 Claude runtime files from repository
- CLAUDE.md files reduced to essential configuration only
- Documentation moved to CLAUDE_METHODOLOGY.md
- Session commands now document failed approaches to avoid repeating dead ends

## Next Step
Monitor usage of new failed approaches sections and refine based on real-world usage

## Failed Approaches
None documented yet - new feature just added
