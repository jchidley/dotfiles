### 10. /tool (11 lines)
**Quality**: Fair - Too minimal
**Issues Found**:
- Just a checklist without actionable steps
- No actual tool loading logic
**Improvements Needed**:
- Add actual implementation steps
- Integrate with standards checking
**Shared Patterns**: File reading

### 11. /wisdom-triggers (52 lines)
**Quality**: Excellent - Clear patterns and examples
**Issues Found**:
- None - this is more of a reference than a command
**Improvements Needed**:
- Consider moving to documentation rather than commands
**Shared Patterns**: Pattern matching, wisdom capture

### 12. /wisdom (72 lines)
**Quality**: Good - Clear purpose and behavior
**Issues Found**:
- Some overlap with clean-wisdom functionality
- Could be more explicit about pattern application
**Improvements Needed**:
- Add examples of pattern application
- Clarify relationship with clean-wisdom
**Shared Patterns**: File reading, pattern application

### 13. /wrap-session (188 lines) ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Quality**: Fair - Comprehensive but overly complex
**Issues Found**:
- Second longest file with 11 sequential steps
- Mixed concerns (git, todos, wisdom, permissions)
- Tool permission management feels out of place
- Complex conditionals throughout
**Improvements Needed**:
- Break into smaller, focused functions
- Extract permission management to separate command
- Simplify step dependencies
**Shared Patterns**: Todo management, git operations, file creation

## Shared Patterns to Extract

### 1. **Timestamp Generation**
Used in: checkpoint, clean-wisdom, wrap-session
```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
CURRENT_DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
```

### 2. **Git Status Checking**
Used in: start, wrap-session
- Branch detection
- Uncommitted changes check
- Recent commits listing

### 3. **Todo Management**
Used in: checkpoint, start, wrap-session
- TodoRead usage
- Status mapping (pending/in_progress/completed)
- Merge logic

### 4. **GitHub Issue Creation**
Used in: req, req-to-issue, find-missing-tests, make-github-issues
- Issue template formatting
- Label assignment
- gh CLI usage

### 5. **File Existence Validation**
Used in: Most commands
- Check before read/write
- Create directories as needed
- Handle missing files gracefully

### 6. **Directory Navigation**
Used in: Most commands
```
cd <working directory from environment info>
```

## Prioritized Recommendations

### Critical (Fix Immediately)
1. **Complete find-missing-tests and make-github-issues** - Currently unusable
2. **Consolidate GitHub issue creation** - Extract shared logic from req/req-to-issue
3. **Add error handling** - Many commands assume success without validation

### High Priority
1. **Refactor clean-wisdom** - Break into focused steps, remove cross-project prompt
2. **Simplify wrap-session** - Extract permission management, reduce complexity
3. **Merge related commands** - Combine req/req-to-issue, find-missing-tests/make-github-issues

### Medium Priority
1. **Extract shared patterns** - Create common includes for timestamps, git ops, etc.
2. **Standardize formatting** - Consistent structure across all commands
3. **Improve tool command** - Add actual implementation beyond checklist

### Low Priority
1. **Move wisdom-triggers** - Convert to documentation rather than command
2. **Add validation** - Ensure required files exist before operations
3. **Enhance security-review** - Add modern security patterns

## Recommended Command Structure Template

```markdown
# /command-name

## Prerequisites
- Required files/state
- Required tools

## Arguments
- $ARGUMENTS parsing if applicable

## Process

### Step 1: Validate Environment
- Check prerequisites
- Validate arguments
- Set up working directory

### Step 2: Core Operations
- Main logic here

## Example Usage
/command-name [arguments]
Expected output: ...
```

## Consistency Improvements

1. **Standardize output indicators**:
   - ‚úÖ Success
   - ‚ùå Error
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
   - üí° Suggestion
   - üìö Information

2. **Consistent error handling**:
   - Always validate before operations
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Suggest recovery actions

3. **Unified git operations**:
   - Always check authentication first
   - Handle both GitHub and non-GitHub repos
   - Consistent status checking

This analysis reveals significant opportunities to improve command quality through consolidation, standardization, and extraction of shared patterns. The most critical issues are the incomplete commands that provide no value in their current state.
