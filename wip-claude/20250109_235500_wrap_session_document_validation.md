# Enhanced /wrap-session with Document Validation
Created: 2025-07-09 11:48

## Enhancement Summary

Updated `/wrap-session` command to proactively validate and create missing key documents, ensuring work continuity across sessions.

## New Features Added

### 1. Document Creation (Step 6)
The command now checks for and creates missing essential documents:

- **HANDOFF.md**: Creates minimal template if missing
- **CURRENT_PROJECT_WISDOM.md**: Creates with header if missing  
- **WORKING_WITH_CLAUDE.md**: Creates symlink to global version if available

### 2. Document Availability Report (Step 9)
Reports what documents are available for the next session:

✓ Available documents:
- HANDOFF.md - Project state and todos
- CURRENT_PROJECT_WISDOM.md - Development insights
- CLAUDE.md - Project-specific instructions
- sessions/ - Historical logs (with count)
- wip-claude/ - Working documents (with count)

⚠️ Missing documents:
- .gitignore - If not present
- README.md - If not present

### 3. Early Timestamp Capture
- Moved timestamp generation to the beginning
- Ensures consistent timestamps throughout the process
- Both `TIMESTAMP` and `CURRENT_DATE` available for all steps

## Benefits

1. **Guaranteed Continuity**: Essential documents always exist for next session
2. **Visibility**: Clear report of available documentation
3. **Proactive Creation**: No manual document creation needed
4. **Consistency**: All timestamps from single source

## Implementation Details

- Document validation happens before HANDOFF.md update
- Missing documents are created with minimal templates
- Symlinks used for shared documents when appropriate
- Non-invasive - only creates truly essential documents

This ensures `/wrap-session` not only saves state but also prepares the environment for seamless continuation in the next session.
