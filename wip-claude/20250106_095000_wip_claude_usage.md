# WIP-Claude Folder Usage Guide

## Purpose

This folder contains temporary work-in-progress documentation created by Claude during development sessions. These files serve dual purposes:
1. **Instructions for Claude** - Structured plans and context for AI assistance
2. **Human-readable documentation** - Clear explanations for human review

## File Naming Convention

All files should include timestamp: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_description.md`

Example: `20250106_095000_refactoring_plan.md`

## Content Types

- **Plans** - Step-by-step approaches to complex tasks
- **Reviews** - Analysis of code or architectural decisions  
- **Reports** - Summaries of work completed or issues found
- **Explanations** - Technical deep-dives or reasoning documentation

## Best Practices

1. Write content that is both instructive for Claude AND understandable by humans
2. Include context, rationale, and clear action items
3. Use markdown formatting for readability
4. Reference relevant project files and documentation
5. Keep files focused on a single topic or task

## Lifecycle

These files are temporary by nature. Once their purpose is served:
- Valuable insights should be moved to PROJECT_WISDOM.md
- Completed plans can be archived or deleted
- Reports may be converted to proper documentation if needed
