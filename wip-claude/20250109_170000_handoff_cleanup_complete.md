# HANDOFF.md Cleanup Complete
Created: 2025-01-09 17:00

## Changes Made

### 1. Cleaned HANDOFF.md
- **Essential Context**: Reduced from 19 lines to 3 lines (84% reduction)
- **Active Todo List**: Removed 10 completed todos, kept only 3 pending
- **Context Reload**: Simplified from 5 verbose entries to 1 concise entry

### 2. Updated /start Command
- Changed from listing context documents to actually reading and echoing them
- Will now display first 10-20 lines of wip-claude documents for immediate context
- More actionable than just showing a list

### 3. Updated /wrap-session Command  
- Added instruction to remove completed todos when updating HANDOFF.md
- Simplified Context Reload section to just list key wip-claude filenames
- Removed redundant document descriptions

## Impact

**Before**: HANDOFF.md was becoming a historical record with excessive completed todos and verbose document lists.

**After**: HANDOFF.md focuses on current state and next actions, with completed work removed and documents echoed when needed.

This maintains the minimal philosophy - only track what's necessary for session continuity.
