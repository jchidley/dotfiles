# Hook-Based Automation Analysis

## Example Hook Configurations

### 1. Python Formatter/Linter Hook
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "^(Write|Edit|MultiEdit)$",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if [[ \"$1\" =~ \\.py$ ]]; then black \"$1\" && ruff check \"$1\" --fix; fi' -- \"$(jq -r .params.file_path < /dev/stdin)\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Bash Script Header Enforcement
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "^Write$",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'file=$(jq -r .params.file_path); if [[ \"$file\" =~ \\.sh$ ]] && ! grep -q \"set -euo pipefail\" \"$file\"; then echo \"ERROR: Missing required bash header\"; exit 2; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Pre-commit Check Runner
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "^(Write|Edit|MultiEdit)$",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command", 
            "command": "bash -c 'cd \"$(dirname \"$(jq -r .params.file_path)\")\"; if [ -f .pre-commit-config.yaml ]; then pre-commit run --files \"$(basename \"$(jq -r .params.file_path)\")\"; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## What Would Change

### Behavioral Shifts with Hooks:

1. **Less Awareness**: Claude might not internalize formatting rules if they're auto-fixed
2. **Dependency on Automation**: Could write sloppier code knowing hooks will clean it
3. **Focus Shift**: More attention on logic/design, less on formatting
4. **Error Learning**: Might not learn from linting errors if auto-fixed

### Practical Implications:

**Current CLAUDE.md Approach**:
- Claude reads: "Always format Python with black"
- Claude writes code → remembers to run black → sees changes → learns patterns
- Sometimes forgets, user reminds

**Hook-Based Approach**:
- Claude writes code → hook runs black automatically
- Claude might not see what changed
- Never forgets, but also never learns

## Hybrid Approach Recommendation

Keep **behavioral guidance** in CLAUDE.md:
- Language selection criteria
- Code quality principles  
- Testing philosophy
- Thinking triggers

Move **mechanical enforcement** to hooks:
- Auto-formatting
- Basic linting
- Header checks
- Simple validations

Add **learning feedback** to hooks:
```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "format-and-report.sh"  
}
```

Where the script formats AND reports what changed back to Claude.

## Critical Insight

The question isn't "hooks OR CLAUDE.md" but rather "what belongs where":
- **CLAUDE.md**: WHY and WHEN (judgment, philosophy, approach)
- **Hooks**: WHAT gets enforced (mechanical rules, automation)
- **Feedback Loop**: HOW Claude learns from automated actions

Without feedback, hooks create a "black box" where Claude loses learning opportunities.

## Pattern Learning Effect

**Critical insight from user**: Claude learns from existing patterns in the codebase itself.

If all files are consistently formatted (via hooks or otherwise), Claude will:
1. **Naturally mimic** the patterns it sees
2. **Internalize conventions** without explicit instructions
3. **Write conforming code** from the start

This suggests that:
- A well-maintained codebase IS the best teacher
- Hooks ensuring consistency might actually ENHANCE Claude's learning
- The "seeing changes" argument is less critical than codebase consistency
- Claude learns more from "what exists" than "what changed"

**Revised conclusion**: Hooks that maintain perfect consistency might teach Claude better than occasional manual corrections. The codebase becomes the implicit style guide.
