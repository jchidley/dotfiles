# CORE Pattern Hooks Implementation Complete
Created: 2025-01-10 00:15

## Summary

Successfully implemented PreToolUse hooks for 2 of the 4 CORE patterns identified through wisdom distillation:

1. ✅ **Chezmoi Source File Discipline** - Prevents editing deployed dotfiles
2. ✅ **Working Directory Management** - Validates cd commands and session file creation

## Implementation Details

### 1. Chezmoi Source File Discipline Hook

**Function**: `check_chezmoi_source_discipline()`

**Enforces**:
- Blocks Edit/Write operations on deployed dotfiles (e.g., `~/.bashrc`)
- Suggests correct source file path (e.g., `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc`)
- Provides both Claude and human-friendly alternatives

**Patterns detected**:
- Any dotfile in home directory starting with `.`
- Files in `.config/` directory
- Files in `.local/bin/`
- SSH config files

**Example error**:
```
ERROR: Cannot edit deployed dotfile directly.
This file is managed by chezmoi and changes will be lost.

Instead, edit the source file:
  /home/jack/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc

Or for humans, use:
  chezmoi edit ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Working Directory Management Hook

**Function**: `check_working_directory_management()`

**Enforces**:
- Blocks `cd ..` and `cd ../` commands (parent directory navigation)
- Blocks ambiguous `cd ~` commands (except to chezmoi source)
- Warns when creating session files without proper directory management

**Patterns blocked**:
- `cd ..` → Use explicit path from environment
- `cd ~/projects` → Avoid ambiguous home references
- `cd ../../tools` → No ancestor directory navigation

**Non-blocking warning**:
- Creating HANDOFF.md, SESSION_*.md, etc. without cd command triggers warning

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suites:
- `test_chezmoi_locally.py` - Tests 8 scenarios for chezmoi discipline
- `test_working_dir.py` - Tests 11 scenarios for directory management
- All tests passing with expected behavior

## Integration with Existing Hooks

The updated pre-validator now enforces:

### Edit/MultiEdit Tools:
1. File existence validation (Phase 1)
2. **Chezmoi source discipline (CORE)**

### Write Tool:
1. Documentation creation control (Phase 1)
2. **Chezmoi source discipline (CORE)**

### Bash Tool:
1. Python version enforcement (Phase 1)
2. Sudo blocking (Phase 1)
3. **Working directory management (CORE)**

## Next Steps

### Remaining CORE Patterns:
3. **Command Instruction Detail** - Audit and enhance all 9 commands
4. **Separation of Concerns** - Extract shared patterns to reference files

### Phase 2 Implementation:
- Test quality validators
- Bash script completeness
- Additional validation patterns

## Benefits

These hooks enforce the most critical patterns discovered across 32 sessions:
- Prevents lost work from editing deployed files
- Ensures session files are created in correct locations
- Reduces common errors that waste time and cause confusion
- Provides clear, actionable error messages

The hooks are now active and will prevent these common mistakes in all future Claude Code sessions.
