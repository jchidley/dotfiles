# Fix: System Timestamps for Session Commands
Created: 2025-07-09 11:44

## Issue
The `/wrap-session` and `/checkpoint` commands were using placeholder timestamps like `[YYYYMMDD]_[HHMMSS]` instead of getting actual system time.

## Solution
Updated both commands to use the `date` command to get real timestamps:

### /wrap-session Changes:
1. Session filename: `TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)` â†’ `SESSION_${TIMESTAMP}.md`
2. HANDOFF.md update: `CURRENT_DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")`

### /checkpoint Changes:
1. Checkpoint timestamp: `TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")`

## Benefits
- Accurate timestamps in session logs
- Proper chronological ordering of session files
- HANDOFF.md shows real update times
- No manual timestamp entry needed

## Implementation
Files updated:
- `dot_claude/commands/wrap-session.md`
- `dot_claude/commands/checkpoint.md`

The changes ensure all timestamps are automatically populated from the system clock rather than requiring Claude to fill in placeholders.
