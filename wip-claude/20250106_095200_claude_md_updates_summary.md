# CLAUDE.md Updates Summary

## Changes Made (2025-01-06)

### 1. Added Documentation & Planning Section

**Location**: After "Core Behaviors" section  
**Purpose**: Establish clear workflow for creating temporary planning and documentation artifacts

**Key elements**:
- Defined wip-claude/ folder as standard location for temporary docs
- Specified timestamp naming convention (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_description.md)
- Listed content types: Plans, Reviews, Reports, Explanations
- Emphasized dual-purpose writing (Claude instructions + human readable)

**Rationale**: 
- Provides structured approach to complex task planning
- Creates audit trail of decision-making
- Enables better handoff between sessions
- Keeps working documents separate from permanent documentation

### 2. Extended Refactoring Discipline Section

**Location**: Within existing "Refactoring Discipline" section  
**Purpose**: Add language-specific guidance for Rust projects

**Added references to**:
- RUST_REFACTORING_RULES.md - Core Rust refactoring principles
- RUST_REFACTORING_BEST_PRACTICES.md - Idiomatic patterns
- RUST_REFACTORING_TOOLS.md - Tooling guidance

**Rationale**:
- Rust has unique ownership/borrowing considerations
- Language-specific patterns require specialized guidance
- Existing files provide comprehensive Rust refactoring framework

## Implementation Notes

1. Created wip-claude/ folder with usage guide README
2. Updated dot_claude/CLAUDE.md (will sync to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md via chezmoi)
3. Maintained existing document structure and formatting style
4. Used clear, actionable language consistent with rest of CLAUDE.md

## Next Steps

- Monitor usage of wip-claude/ folder in practice
- Consider adding example templates for common document types
- Potentially add cleanup/archival guidelines for old wip documents
