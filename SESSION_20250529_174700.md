# Session Log: Chezmoi Dotfiles
Date: 2025-05-29
Duration: ~2 minutes

## Summary
Quick maintenance session to commit and push documentation updates and shell hint fixes that were staged but not yet committed.

## Key Accomplishments
- Updated HANDOFF.md to reflect completed repository cleanup status
- Fixed Windows Terminal (wt.exe) command syntax in bash_shell_hints
- Added wt.exe hint to dot_bashrc.tmpl for easier access

## Technical Insights
The wt.exe command requires proper syntax - using wt.exe directly rather than the wt() function wrapper for the initial command ensures proper execution.

## Challenges Encountered
None - straightforward commit and push operation.

## Files Modified
- HANDOFF.md
- bash_shell_hints
- dot_bashrc.tmpl

## Next Session Priority
Test refactored slash commands to ensure they execute correctly, particularly /start, /checkpoint, and /wrap-session which are critical for session management.
