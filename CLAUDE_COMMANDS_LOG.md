# Claude Commands Development Log

## Session 2025-05-29: Fixed /req Command Execution

### Key Accomplishments
- Diagnosed why /req command wasn't executing properly in Claude Code
- Fixed command documentation to be more directive for Claude execution
- Added clarification about how slash commands work in Claude Code
- Updated both global and project CLAUDE.md files with explanation

### Git Activity
```
ac00c97 fix(claude): improve /req command execution in Claude Code
```

### Discoveries
- Claude Code slash commands work differently than traditional executable commands
- When a slash command is invoked, Claude Code shows the command documentation to Claude
- Claude is expected to read and execute the instructions, not just display them
- Adding explicit "YOU MUST execute" language helps ensure proper execution

### Technical Details
- Updated `/req` command with clear execution instructions
- Made each subcommand have explicit step-by-step actions
- Added note explaining slash command behavior to CLAUDE.md files
- Key insight: Commands need to instruct Claude, not just document features

### Next Session Priority
- Test the /req command with actual requirement additions
- Continue with new development tasks as needed

## Session 2025-05-29 (Part 2): Enhanced /req Commands with GitHub Integration

### Key Accomplishments
- Fixed /req command to properly create GitHub issues with detailed implementation tracking
- Ensured /req commands manage local REQUIREMENTS.md files correctly
- Implemented dual-track design: lean local files for Claude context, detailed GitHub issues
- Added comprehensive GitHub issue template with sections for design, technical notes, progress tracking

### Git Activity
```
7e76aba docs: update HANDOFF.md to clarify dual-track requirements design
4db6332 fix(claude): ensure /req commands properly manage REQUIREMENTS.md files
f3834b2 feat(claude): enhance /req commands with GitHub issue integration
```

### Discoveries
- Dual-track requirements approach is optimal for Claude Code:
  - REQUIREMENTS.md stays lean to preserve context (just ID, name, status, link)
  - GitHub issues contain all implementation details, code examples, progress
- /req command needed to both manage local files AND create GitHub issues
- Template-based approach ensures consistent GitHub issue structure

### Technical Details
- Enhanced `/req add` to:
  - Check for existing REQUIREMENTS.md or create from template
  - Parse existing REQ numbers and assign next sequential
  - Add requirement with proper formatting
  - Remind user to create GitHub issue
- Enhanced `/req-to-issue` to:
  - Create comprehensive GitHub issue with implementation template
  - Update REQUIREMENTS.md with issue number after creation
  - Include sections for design decisions, technical approach, testing strategy
- Both commands work together for complete workflow

### Next Session Priority
- Continue using the enhanced /req workflow as designed - lean local files, detailed GitHub issues

# Claude Commands Development Log

## Session 2025-05-28: Requirements Management Enhancement

Enhanced Claude Code command system with requirements tracking capability to ensure consistent project requirement management even in long conversations.

### Key Accomplishments
- Created /req command for requirements management
- Updated CLAUDE.md to reference the new command
- Added git push reminders to checkpoint and wrap-session commands

### Git Activity
```
235fd22 docs(claude): add git push reminders to checkpoint and wrap-session commands
676bf00 feat(claude): add /req command for requirements management
```

### Technical Details
- /req command provides subcommands: check, add, list, status
- Helps distinguish between project requirements and regular tasks
- Integrates with existing GitHub issue workflow via /req-to-issue

### Next Session Priority
- Ready for new development tasks

## Session 2025-05-29: Requirements Command Testing

Tested and verified the /req command system functionality, ensuring all commands work as designed for the dual-track requirements approach.

### Key Accomplishments
- Tested all /req command variations (check, add, list, status)
- Verified template files are in expected state
- Created and removed test REQUIREMENTS.md file
- Confirmed command file formats (mixed intentionally)
- Updated HANDOFF.md to reflect current state

### Git Activity
```
# No new commits this session
# Uncommitted changes:
- CLAUDE_COMMANDS_LOG.md (this entry)
- HANDOFF.md (updated status)
```

### Technical Details
- `/req list` correctly reports when no REQUIREMENTS.md exists
- `/req check` properly distinguishes project requirements from regular tasks
- `/req add` creates REQUIREMENTS.md from template if missing, assigns sequential REQ numbers
- `/req status` shows detailed requirement info, handles non-existent REQs gracefully
- `/req-to-issue` structure verified (requires GitHub auth for actual execution)

### Discoveries
- Only /req and /req-to-issue commands use "CLAUDE INSTRUCTION" format
- Other commands are documentation or simple prompts (intentional design)
- Test REQUIREMENTS.md successfully created with REQ-0001 and REQ-0002
- Templates all verified to be in correct state

### Next Session Priority
- Ready for new development tasks - requirements system operational
