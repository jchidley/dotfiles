# Claude Commands Development Log

## Session 2025-05-29: Fixed /req Command Execution

### Key Accomplishments
- Diagnosed why /req command wasn't executing properly in Claude Code
- Fixed command documentation to be more directive for Claude execution
- Added clarification about how slash commands work in Claude Code
- Updated both global and project CLAUDE.md files with explanation

### Git Activity
```
ac00c97 fix(claude): improve /req command execution in Claude Code
```

### Discoveries
- Claude Code slash commands work differently than traditional executable commands
- When a slash command is invoked, Claude Code shows the command documentation to Claude
- Claude is expected to read and execute the instructions, not just display them
- Adding explicit "YOU MUST execute" language helps ensure proper execution

### Technical Details
- Updated `/req` command with clear execution instructions
- Made each subcommand have explicit step-by-step actions
- Added note explaining slash command behavior to CLAUDE.md files
- Key insight: Commands need to instruct Claude, not just document features

### Next Session Priority
- Test the /req command with actual requirement additions
- Continue with new development tasks as needed
